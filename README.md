- Architecture
  - MVVM Architecture (Model- View - ViewModel)
  - Repository Pattern
- [Kotlin 1.4](https://kotlinlang.org/) based, [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) + [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/) for asynchronous.
